# Ideation Phase - Requirements Brainstorming

## Your Task
Analyze the following idea and produce a comprehensive requirements document.

## The Idea
{{IDEA}}

## Instructions

### 1. Understand the Core Concept
- What is the main purpose of this application?
- Who are the target users?
- What problem does it solve?
- What makes this solution unique or valuable?

### 2. Define User Requirements
- List all user-facing features
- Describe user workflows and journeys
- Identify user personas (if applicable)
- Define user stories in the format: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"

### 3. Technical Requirements
- What data needs to be stored?
- What integrations might be needed?
- Performance requirements (response times, concurrent users)
- Security considerations (authentication, authorization, data protection)
- Scalability requirements

### 4. Edge Cases & Constraints
- What could go wrong?
- Error handling scenarios
- Rate limiting considerations
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG compliance)
- Browser/device compatibility

### 5. Success Criteria
- How will we know the project is complete?
- What are the MVP features vs nice-to-haves?
- What metrics will define success?

## Output Format
Write a structured requirements document in Markdown format. Save it as `requirements.md` in the project directory.

The document MUST include these sections:

```markdown
